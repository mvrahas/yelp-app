# Yelp App

## About

This mobile application uses the Yelp API to fetch info about restaurants and businesses in different cities. Search by a city or location to browse a list of restaurants and businesses and get helpful information. I built this project following the instructions in [The Complete React Native + Hooks Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/), adding my own personal touches as well.

## Run the Project

1) Clone the repository
2) Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in the directory
3) Run `npx expo start`
4) Download Expo Go from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) or [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US&gl=US)
5) Scan the QR code with your camera
